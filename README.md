### How It Works
  1. User enters a city name in the input field.
  2. On form submission:
    Input is validated, 
    API request is triggered
  3. Weather data is fetched asynchronously.
  4. UI updates dynamically with:
    Temperature, 
    Location, 
    Weather condition
5. Errors or loading states are handled gracefully.
